## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Production Build

npm run build
```

## 🌐 Deployment Configuration

To ensure seamless routing on Vercel, the project uses a vercel.json rewrite configuration in the root directory. This redirects all server requests to index.html, allowing React Router to handle the URL logic.

```JSON
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
